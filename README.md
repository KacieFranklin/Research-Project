# Perseplax
  
## Purpose:
Our website serves to allow users to create 3-D looking images with a parallax effect that can be saved and seemlessly imported into their HTML webpages.

## Audience:
Perseplax is for anyone with an interest in art 

## Live Site:

## Design Rationale:
We all have art as a common interest and believed it would be fun to create an art website that users can use for free to draw.

In our research of similar webpages we found both pros and cons for all three sites

## Key Features:
Our website features a Homepage, an About us page, a Contact page, a Blog/News page, a FAQ page, an Error 404 page, a Terms and Service page and the Drawing tool page.

For the mobile version, the Hamburger Menu can be pressed which displays a box with links for all the pages and remains on screen when scrolling.
The Terms and Services page is a simple form where clicking 'Accept' brings the user to the homepage.
The About page has hover effects when the mouse goes over the text and smaller headings.
The FAQ page also has hover effects, making the boxes move up slightly when the mouse is on them, as well as expanding the text boxes upon clicking 'Read more'.
The Blog/News page uses the same hover effects as the FAQ page on its boxes.
The Contact Us page has cards that expand, change opacity as well as the box-shadow becoming solid when the mouse hovers over them.
Finally for the Products and Services page the icons glow when the mouse hovers over them and more boxes display to the right of the icons.

All of our pages are responsive, fitting any screen size. We aimed to keep every screen size as consistent as possible with the smaller screens and mobile version 
having some small differences. For the mobile version the cards on the Contact page are aligned vertically and the icons on the Products and Services page always has the information about the tools shown.
For accsessibility, we have alt text for every image throughout the site for anyone with vision impairment to be able to use a screen reader.
We intend to have an option in the Drawing Tool to allow anyone with any form of colourblindness to change the colours of the colour wheel.
## Technologies Used:

## Team Contributions:
### Kacie Franklin: 
I mainly contributed to the About page, Terms of Service page and the Products and Services page.
I had also created the brush, eraser, lasso, drag and cut tool icons as well as adding the footer.
It was a struggle learning Svelte at first, I wouldn't say I'm an expert at it, but I feel like I have a better understanding of it now.
